Hi! I'm Ben, and I work on the [UK's National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI)](https://naei.beis.gov.uk). I'm the current Air Quality Lead, and work with the wider team to estimate emissions of over 60 pollutants from 1990 onwards.

In particular, I help calculate emissions of Nitrogen Oxides (NO~X~), Particulate Matter < 2.5 um (PM~2.5~), Ammonia (NH~3~), Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOCs) and Sulphur Dioxide (SO~2~) and ascertain the UK's compliance against NECR Emission Reduction Commitments.

Additionally, I help produce projections of emissions of the above pollutants through to 2040.

The NAEI also estimates the emissions of UK Greenhouse Gas emissions (including Carbon Dioxide (CO~2~), Methane (CH~4~), and Nitrous Oxide (N~2~O)) from 1990 onwards and reports these to the UNFCCC.
