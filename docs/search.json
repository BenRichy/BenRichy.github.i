    "text": "Hi! I’m Ben, and I work on the UK’s National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI). I’m the current Air Quality Lead, and work with the wider team to estimate emissions of over 60 pollutants from 1990 onwards.\nIn particular, I help calculate emissions of Nitrogen Oxides (NOX), Particulate Matter &lt; 2.5 um (PM2.5), Ammonia (NH3), Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOCs) and Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) and ascertain the UK’s compliance against NECR Emission Reduction Commitments.\nAdditionally, I help produce projections of emissions of the above pollutants through to 2040.\nThe NAEI also estimates the emissions of UK Greenhouse Gas emissions (including Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), and Nitrous Oxide (N2O)) from 1990 onwards and reports these to the UNFCCC.\nOutside of working on the NAEI, my expertise also includes:\n\nUpgrading legacy systems from Excel/Access, and developing new systems into R/SQL\nCLRTAP Lead Reviewer for the Stage 3 Review of Parties on behalf of CEIP\nEstimates of NMVOC emissions from the solvents sector\nEstimating annual emissions for the UK’s Devolved Administrations\n\nTo learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites."
