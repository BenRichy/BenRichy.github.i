I’m the current Air Quality Lead, and work with the wider team to estimate emissions of over 60 pollutants from 1990 onwards.\nIn particular, I help calculate emissions of Nitrogen Oxides (NOX), Particulate Matter < 2.5 um (PM2.5), Ammonia (NH3), Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOCs) and Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) and ascertain the UK’s compliance against NECR Emission Reduction Commitments.\nAdditionally, I help produce projections of emissions of the above pollutants through to 2040.\nThe NAEI also estimates the emissions of UK Greenhouse Gas emissions (including Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), and Nitrous Oxide (N20)) from 1990 onwards and reports these to the UNFCCC.\nTo learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites."
