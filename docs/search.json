I’m the current Air Quality Lead, and work with the wider team to estimate emissions of over 60 pollutants from 1990 onwards.\nIn particular, we calculate emissions of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), Particulate Matter < 2.5 um (PM2.5), Ammonia (NH3), Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOCs) and Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) and ascertain the UK’s compliance against NECR Emission Reduction Commitments.\nAdditionally, we produce projections of emissions of the above pollutants through to 2040.\nTo learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites."
